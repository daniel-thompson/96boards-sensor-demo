96Boards Sensor Demo
====================

This is a simple demo I created when I had to take a DB410C and the
Grove sensor kit to a school careers evening.

A bunch of sensors are arbitrarily connected to some actuators and
displays. The challenge for children who don't want to talk about how
awesome a career as a programmer would be, it to figure out what sensor
does what...

What can I say? It's simple but it got me plenty of attention both from
children, parents and other presenters!
